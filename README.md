# Design and programming of analog and digital electronic circuits:

#### Distance measurement of the type of analog :bulb: :
##### - *Explanation of the circuit* :mag_right: :
###### The function of the circuit is to measure the distance between the sensor and an obstacle, and print the result on the serial monitor screen
##### - *used gear* :
###### :small_orange_diamond: Arduino UNO board, or any board compatible with it.
###### :small_orange_diamond: Electronic workout board.
###### :small_orange_diamond: Jumper-Wire connection wires.
###### :small_orange_diamond: Ultrasonic distance sensor.

##### - *gear connection* :
###### :small_orange_diamond: Connect 5V, GND to the distance sensor.
###### :small_orange_diamond: Connect the trig insert to a digital insert that works in the output mode, let it be the number 8 insert.
###### :small_orange_diamond: Connect the echo pin to a digital pin that works in the input mode, let it be the pin number 9.

##### The shape of the general circuit diagram is:
